Here is to show that I now know to create a file on a cloned repository.\
I learnt to do this on my first project with alx software engineering program.\
The project taught specifically on Git, Github, and activities that can be done using the command line.\
I have used the lessons learnt in this project to create this README file if you are able to read it on my course Repo.\
Thank you alx!
